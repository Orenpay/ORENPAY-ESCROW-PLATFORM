## Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`.
2. Use branch names like:
   - `feature/<area>-<feature-name>`
   - `fix/<area>-<issue-description>`
   - `security/<test-or-audit>`
   
Example: `feature/frontend-login-page`

3. Open a Pull Request (PR) to `main`.
4. PR must be reviewed and approved before merging.
